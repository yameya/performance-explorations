## Context
This folder contains three simple spring boot applications:
1. httpclients
2. httpclients-withpooling
3. httpclients-withoutpooling

httpclients exposes a API performanceStatsGet to fetch some CPU stats of the JVM process hosting the application.

httpclients-withpooling exposes a API getRemotePerformanceStats which when called, calls the performanceStatsGet API using pooled http connections using RestTemplate

httpclients-withpooling exposes a API getRemotePerformanceStats which when called, calls the performanceStatsGet API using RestTemplate which creates a new HttpConnection on every call.

#### The prupose of this project was to analyze and compare the performace of pooled and non-pooled http connections.

## Testing reports:
For both pooled and non-pooled connections, the read timeout and connection timeout was configured to be 5 seconds.
All the three applications were hosted on docker containers using the docker-compose and the tool used to fire requests is Apache JMeter. The below reports summarize the results.

### Report

![Report Table](PoolingThroughputGraph.png?raw=true)

#### Conclusion: The conclusion that can be drawn based on the above reports is that the pooled connections yeild better results, especially when the load on the application is high.


## Installation:
To install this application, clone the project onto to your machine and navigate to the root folder of this project where docker-compose.yml file resides.
Then run the below command:
docker-compose up --build

## Usage:
Fire below API's:
localhost:8082/getRemotePerformanceStats -> For Testing non-pooled http connections using RestTemplate.

localhost:8083/getRemotePerformanceStats -> For Testing pooled http connections using RestTemplate.
